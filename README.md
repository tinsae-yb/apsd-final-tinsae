<h1>Problem statement</h1>

A car rental company requires the development of a basic Car Rental Management System (CRMS) to streamline its operations and improve customer service. The system aims to provide essential functionalities for managing rental vehicles, reservations, and customer interactions while accommodating different user roles within the organization. The project entails the development of the following features:

1. **Fleet Management**: The CRMS should allow administrators to add new vehicles to the rental fleet, update vehicle details such as make, model, year, mileage, and availability status, and track the overall fleet inventory.

2. **Reservation Management**: Customers should be able to make reservations for rental vehicles through the system. They should be able to specify pick-up/drop-off locations, rental duration, vehicle preferences, and receive confirmation of their bookings.

3. **Customer Management**: The system should maintain a database of customer information, including personal details, contact information, rental history, and preferences. It should support user registration, login authentication, and profile management functionalities.

4. **Rental Transactions**: The CRMS should facilitate the processing of rental transactions, including booking confirmation, rental agreements, payment processing, and generation of rental contracts and receipts for customers.

5. **Security**: Basic security measures should be implemented to protect user data and system integrity. This may include password hashing for user authentication, access controls to limit unauthorized access, and encryption of sensitive information.

6. **User Roles**: The system should support different user roles, including:
    - Administrators: Responsible for managing the overall system, including fleet and customer management, user roles, and system configuration.
    - Rental Agents: Handle customer interactions, process reservations, manage rental transactions, and assist customers with inquiries.
    - Customers: Have access to the reservation system, can make bookings, view rental history, and manage their profiles.

7. **Integration and Scalability**: The system should be designed for easy integration with other systems and platforms in the future. It should also be scalable to accommodate future enhancements or expansions of the rental business.

8. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation should be provided for the CRMS, including user manuals, technical documentation, and any other relevant materials to aid in understanding and using the system effectively.

The successful implementation of the Car Rental Management System will optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance the overall efficiency of the rental business while accommodating the needs of different user roles within the organization.
